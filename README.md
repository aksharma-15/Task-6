# Task-6

## Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations in SQL
## Reminder: I use MS-SQL server management studio so there's no need to end the queries with a semicolon as it executes them without it.
## I have generated the data using AI as I was not able to find the required dataset elsewhere. I have provided the csv file along with the sql queries and outputs that were required for the task.
